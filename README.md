# FastAPI Example

This repository contains a simple FastAPI application that serves a "Hello World" message at the root URL. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```
````

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

- On Windows:

  ```sh
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```sh
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Running the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- `main` refers to the filename `main.py`.
- `app` refers to the FastAPI instance inside `main.py`.
- `--reload` enables auto-reload, so the server will restart whenever you make changes to the code.

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the "Hello World" message.

## Code Explanation

### `main.py`

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

- `from fastapi import FastAPI`: Import the FastAPI class from the `fastapi` package.
- `app = FastAPI()`: Create an instance of the FastAPI class.
- `@app.get("/")`: Define a route for the root URL (`/`). When a GET request is made to this URL, the `read_root` function is called.
- `def read_root()`: This function returns a JSON response with the message `{"Hello": "World"}`.

## Additional Information

### Interactive API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation. You can access it at the following URLs once the server is running:

- Swagger UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- ReDoc: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

### Stopping the Server

To stop the server, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where the server is running.
